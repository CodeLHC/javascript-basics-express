# JavaScript Katas with TDD, Express and Postman
This project build on my previous repo for Javascript Katas that are developed by using test-driven development principles. This uses Express to create and API which can be tested in Postman. 

This project involves JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js and PostMan.

# Installation and Usage
You can clone this repo to your local machine, and in the project directory terminal you can install the required dependencies using 'npm install'.

You can run the tests from the __tests__ directory using the command 'npm test', and start the Express server with 'npm start'. This starts the server on the Local Host port 3000. 

This API uses several endpoints which can be tested using Postman. You can find these endpoints in the app.js file.
